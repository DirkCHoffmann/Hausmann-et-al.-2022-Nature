Glioblastoma cell networks harbor a plastic population of highly active glioblastoma cells that display rhythmic Ca2+ oscillations and are particularly connected to others.
Targeting the autonomous rhythmic activity of periodic tumor cells by pharmacological interference with the potassium channel KCa3.1 strongly compromised global network communication.
This led to a marked reduction of tumor cell viability within the entire network, reduced tumor growth in mice, and prolonged animal survival.
The dependency of glioblastoma networks on periodic Ca2+ activity generates a vulnerability that can be exploited for the development of novel therapies, with KCa3.1 inhibiting drugs as one example.

To allow reproduction of the performed analysis of microscope images we here provide the codes.
Importantly, the Fiji macro needs to be run first and the Matlab codes second.
